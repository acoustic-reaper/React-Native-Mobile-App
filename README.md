# React-Native-Mobile-App
Hi, this repo contains code of one of the two applications built for submission in Software Development PS under
Techshila, Inter Bhawan Tech Meet organized by Student's Technical Council, IIT Roorkee.
The task was to build a simple mobile application that can shutdown/hibernate/logoff/restart the user's PC remotely via an
access code. The basic architecture included a basic front-end (to gain access to PC), a backend (to handle routing, API's and
other business logic), and a desktop application(which would be installed on the PC and will have access to PC's processes).

This is The Mobile Application code written in React Native:
## Here's how to test it (NodeJS should be installed on your system): 
(You also need to run the desktop application in another PC to test the complete project, Link to desktop
application repository: https://github.com/acoustic-reaper/Electron-App).

## Step 1:
### Clone this repo in your own system using:
```
git clone https://github.com/acoustic-reaper/React-Native-Mobile-App.git
```

## Step 2:
```
cd ./React-Native-Mobile-App
```

## Step 3:
### Install the required Node dependencies using:
```
npm i
```

## Step 4:
```
cd ./MyFirstApp
```

## Step 5:
### Install Node dependencies here too :)
```
npm i
```
### Now you are good to test the app

## Step 6
### Start the app by running
```
npm start
```
### This should show you some content in your terminal. Type w to open the app in web mode or Type a(if you got Android SDK :))

## Done. You are now good to test the app.
## P.S. Suggestions will be appreciated. You are welcome to send pull requests.
